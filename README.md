This repository contains a comprehensive, project-based tutorial that guides you through building sophisticated chatbots and AI applications using LangChain. You will learn everything from the fundamentals of chat models to advanced concepts like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agents, and custom tools.

## üöÄ What You'll Learn

This course is structured into five key areas, each building upon the last:

1.  **Chat Models:** Understand the core components of LangChain and how to interact with different Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini.
2.  **Prompt Templates:** Master the art of prompt engineering by creating dynamic, reusable prompt templates to guide LLM responses effectively.
3.  **Chains (using LangChain Expression Language - LCEL):** Learn to chain components together to create complex and powerful logic flows. Explore sequential, parallel, and branching chains to build sophisticated applications.
4.  **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Dive deep into the RAG architecture. You'll learn how to connect your LLM to external data sources, including:
    *   Loading and splitting documents (text files, web pages).
    *   Creating and storing vector embeddings using models like ChromaDB.
    *   Building retrievers to fetch relevant information for your chatbot.
    *   Implementing conversational RAG systems that can remember past interactions.
5.  **Agents and Tools:** Go beyond simple chains by building intelligent agents that can use tools to interact with the outside world. Learn how to create custom tools and leverage pre-built ones (like Wikipedia or Tavily Search) to give your agents powerful new capabilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

This project is configured to use `uv`, a fast and modern Python package manager.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- `uv` installed on your system. You can find installation instructions [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hereandnowai/langchain-chatbots-with-rag-agents-and-tools.git
    cd langchain-chatbots-with-rag-agents-and-tools
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    uv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    `uv` will install all required packages from the `pyproject.toml` file.
    ```bash
    uv pip install -e .
    ```

5.  **Set up your API keys:**
    Create a `.env` file by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Now, open the `.env` file and add your API keys for services like OpenAI, Google, Firecrawl, etc.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The tutorial code is organized into numbered directories, each focusing on a specific concept:

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1_chat_models/         # Basics of interacting with LLMs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2_prompt_templates/    # Crafting effective prompts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 3_chains/              # Building application logic with LCEL
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 4_rag/                 # All about Retrieval-Augmented Generation
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ books/             # Sample text files for RAG
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/             # Utility scripts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 5_agents_and_tools/    # Creating intelligent agents and tools
```

Each file is a self-contained script that you can run and experiment with.
